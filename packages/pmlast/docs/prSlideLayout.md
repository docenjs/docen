# PresentationML Slides - Layout

A slide layout is essentially a template design which can be applied to one or more slides, defining the default appearance and positioning of objects on the slide. It "sits" on top of the master slide, acting as an override to alter or supplement information provided on the master slide. When applied to a slide, all corresponding content within objects on the slide is mapped to the slide layout placeholders.

There may be one or more slide layouts in a presentation. Each slide layout is a separate part within a slideLayouts directory. The slide layouts are referenced explicitly by the master slide in its .rels file so that each layout that can be applied to slides based upon the master is a target of relationship. So, for example, in the slideMaster1.xml.rels file (the relationships for the master slide), there is a relationship to slideLayout1.xml: <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/slideLayout" Target="../slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"/>. Conversely, for each slide layout there is a relationship to the master slide: The slideLayout1.xml.rels contains the following relationship: <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/slideMaster" Target="../slideMasters/slideMaster1.xml"/>. A presentation slide will have a relationship to the layout slide that is applied to its content, and the relationship will be within the .rels file for that slide (i.e., within slide1.xml.rels for slide 1). The following is the relationship to the layout applied to the second slide: <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/slideLayout" Target="../slideLayouts/slideLayout2.xml"/>

The content model for a slide layout is similar to a master slide, except that it does not contain a text styles element, and it has a color map override rather than a color map. (And of course there is no slide layout list.) See [Slides - Overview](prSlide.md) for a comparison of the content models of the various slide types. The root element of a slide layout is the <p:sldLayout> element. Below is a table showing the possible children of the root element, followed by a table showing the attributes of the root <p:sldLayout> element.

### Elements:

| Element        | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p:clrMapOvr>  | Specifies overrides of the color scheme that is specified in the master slide's <p:clrMap>. For details, see [Slide Properties - Color Scheme](prSlide-color.md).                     |
| <p:cSld>       | Specifies the slide content. For details, see [Slides - Common Slide Data](prCommonSlideData.md).                                                                                     |
| <p:hf>         | Specifies header and footer information for a slide. For details, see [Properties - Headers and Footers](prSlide-footer.md).                                                          |
| <p:timing>     | Specifies the timing information for animations and timed events within a slide.                                                                                                      |
| <p:transition> | Specifies the kind of transition that should be used to transition to the current slide from the previous slide. For details, see [Properties - Transitions](prSlide-transitions.md). |

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| matchingName     | Specifies a name to be used in place of the name attribute on <p:cSld>. See [Slides - Common Slide Data](prCommonSlideData.md). It is used for layout matching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| preserve         | Specifies whether the layout should be deleted when all slides that follow the layout are deleted. The default value is false, so that the layout is deleted if the attribute is unspecified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| showMasterPhAnim | Specifies whether to display animations on placeholders from the master slide.

| type             | Specifies the layout type, which provides a high-level description of the content type and postitioning of placeholders on a slide. This information can be used by applications to aid in mapping between different layouts; the appliation can choose which, if any, to make available. A complate list of possible values can be found at ECMA-376, 3rd Edition (June, 2011), Fundamentals and Markup Language Reference ยง 19.7.15. Examples include blank, picTx (a title, picture and caption text), secHead (section header and subtitle text), title (title layout with centered title and subtitle placeholders), and tx (title and text). |
| userDrawn        | Specifies whether the object has been drawn by the user and should therefore not be deleted. Values are booleans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
