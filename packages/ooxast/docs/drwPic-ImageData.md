# DrawingML Pictures

Image Properties - Image Data

The image data for a picture is specified with the <a:blip> element within the <pic:blipFill> element (BLIP = binary large image or picture). Note the namespace used is xmlns:a="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main". The image data can be stored locally within the same file, or linked to a location outside of the file. The state of compression for the data is also specified. All of this information is contained within the attributes for <a:blip>.

<pic:blipFill>

<a:blip r:embed="rId4" cstate="print"/>

<a:stretch>

<a:fillRect/>

</a:stretch/>

</pic:blipFill>
