Vertical Text Alignment

The alignment of characters on each line is specified with the <w:textAlignment> element. This is relevant when characters within a line vary in size. If the line height is larger than one or more characters on the line, all characters are aligned to the maximum character extent as specified by this element.

<w:pPr>

<w:textAlignment w:val="center"/>

</w:pPr>

Then they start and tremble, they call us by our name, and as soon as we have recognized their voice the spell is broken. We have delivered them: they have overcome death and return to share our life.
