Text Borders

The border for text runs is specified with the <w:bdr> element within the <w:rPr> element. Note that the border is a complete four-sided border. Unlike a paragraph border, there is no way to specify which sides should have borders. Also note that adjacent text runs with identical attributes will be rendered as a single border.

<w:rPr>

<w:bdr w:val="single" w:sz="36" w:space="0" w:color="B8CCE4" />

</w:rPr>

### Attributes

The most commonly used attributes are below (theme-related attributes are omitted).

| Attributes | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| color      | Specifies the color of the border. Values are given as hex values (in RRGGBB format). No #, unlike hex values in HTML/CSS. E.g., color="FFFF00". A value of auto is also permitted and will allow the consuming word processor to determine the color. This attribute will be ignored if a theme color is specified.                                                    |
| frame      | Specifies whether the border should be modified to create a frame effect by reversing the border's appearance from the edge nearest the text to the edge furthest from the text. Permitted values are true and false.                                                                                                                                                   |
| shadow     | Specifies whether the border should be modified to create the appearance of a shadow. For right and bottom borders, this is done by duplicating the border below and right of the normal location. For the right and top borders, this is done by moving the border down and to the right of the original location. Permitted values are true and false.                |
| space      | Specifies the spacing offset. Values are specified in points (1/72nd of an inch).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| sz         | Specifies the width of the border. Text borders are line borders (see the val attribute below), and so the width is specified in eighths of a point, with a minimum value of two (1/4 of a point) and a maximum value of 96 (twelve points). (Page borders can alternatively be art borders, with the width is given in points and a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 31.) |
| val        | Specifies the style of the border. Text borders can be only line borders. (Page borders can also be art borders.) Possible values are:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
