Defining a Particular Level - Justification

The justification for the numbering level's text is specified with the <w:lvlJc> element. If omitted, justification will be left for left-to-right paragraphs.

![](images/note.png)Note: This element does not determine the justification for the paragaph. That justification is determined by the <w:jc> element within the <w:pPr> element. The justification as specified in the <w:lvlJc> element is applied relative to the text margin of the parent numbered paragraph. So, for example, if the justification is set to be left justified for a left-to-right paragraph (i.e., <w:lvlJc w:val="start"/>), then the numbering will extend left from the text margin towards the text.

A numbering level's text is the numeral (e.g., "1)"), symbol (e.g., โข), character (e.g., "-"), or graphic used to form the level, as specified in the lvlText element. See the samle below for a comparison of left and right justification.

<w:lvl w:ilvl="0">

<w:start w:val="1"/>

<w:numFmt w:val="decimal"/>

<w:lvlText w:val="%1."/>

<w:lvlJc w:val="end"/>

<w:pPr>

<w:ind w:start="720" w:hanging="360"/>

</w:pPr>

</w:lvl>
